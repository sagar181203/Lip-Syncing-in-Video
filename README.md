# Lip-Syncing-in-Video
Process to Lip Sync the video with FFMPEG using Blender



Lip-Sync Video with Wav2Lip
This project demonstrates how to perform lip-syncing using Wav2Lip, a model for accurately synchronizing lips in videos to speech audio. The workflow includes text-to-speech synthesis, generating lip-synced videos, and working with models for seamless integration of audio and visual elements.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
FFmpeg
Blender
Install dependencies for Wav2Lip
Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the Wav2Lip repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git
cd Wav2Lip
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install all necessary Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Install FFmpeg
To work with videos, you need to install and configure FFmpeg. Download it from the FFmpeg website and ensure it is added to your system's PATH.

Step 4: Download the Wav2Lip GAN Model
Download the pre-trained model wav2lip_gan.pth from Kaggle and place it in the Wav2Lip/checkpoints/ folder.

Step 5: Install Text-to-Speech API
You can install the TTS API using:

bash
Copy code
pip install TTS
Step 6: Text-to-Speech (TTS) Example
Generate speech from text using the TTS API with the following code:

python
Copy code
from TTS.api import TTS

# Initialize TTS with an English model
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC", progress_bar=False)

# Generate speech and save to a file
text = "Hello, I am your virtual assistant."
tts.tts_to_file(text=text, file_path="output_en.wav")
This will generate an audio file output_en.wav.

Step 7: Perform Lip-Syncing
Run the following command to perform lip-syncing on a video using the generated audio:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py --checkpoint_path "Wav2Lip/checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth" --face "path_to_face_image.jpg" --audio "output_en.wav" --outfile result_lipsynced.mp4
Ensure to replace path_to_face_image.jpg with the path to your image or video file.

Step 8: Avatar Creation
To further enhance the lip-syncing, download Blender and use it to create a custom avatar for lip-syncing.
